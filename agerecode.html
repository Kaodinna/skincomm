      </div>
      <div class="pt-4 text-justify">
        <p>AgeRecode<sup>&reg;</sup> is curated with our proprietary blend of plant-based essential nutrients and herbal active ingredients, such as Astragalus, Trans-Resveratrol, CoEnzyme Q10, White Mulberry Leaf Extract, Pea Peptide, L-Glutathione, more than 29 active ingredients to attain these 4 key components:</p>

        <p>
          1. Boosts Mitochondrial Function, a powerhouse in every cell to improve energy production <br>
          by converting nutrients and oxygen into energy-rich molecules. <br>
          Our organs, tissues, and cells need these molecules to function normally
        </p>

        <p>2. Stimulates Telomerase for Telomere Regeneration to slow down aging process</p>

        <p>
          3. Activates Longevity Gene, Sirtuin (SIRT1) by binding to and activating a protein called AMP-activated <br>
          protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK, when activated, stimulates the production of NAD+,which is a <br>
          co-factor required for SIRT1 activity
        </p>

        <p>
          4. Provides essential nutrients that our body cannot produce and are vital for <br>
          growth, development, repair and overall health.
        </p>

        <p>In addition, AgeRecode<sup>&reg;</sup> addresses other factors that accelerate aging, including glycation, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, hormonal changes, epigenetic modifications, metabolic decline, and reduced autophagy. These internal processes lead to cellular damage and hinder the body’s natural repair mechanisms. Additionally, external influences such as UV radiation, pollution, and unhealthy lifestyle choices—including smoking and poor diet—speed up the aging process. Together, these factors increase susceptibility to age-related diseases and negatively affect overall health and vitality.</p>
        <p>These ingredients are meticulously combined in their most effective dosages and in highly bioavailable forms, ensuring optimal absorption by your body, resulting in the creation of One Perfect Formula.</p>
