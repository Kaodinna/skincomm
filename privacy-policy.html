      <h6 class="fw-bold">Third Party Internet-Based Advertising</h6>
      <p>
        We may use the services of one or more third party companies for internet-based advertising (also called “targeted advertising”, “remarketing”, or “behavioural advertising”).

We may use and allow our third party advertising companies to use the technologies listed above (see “Third Party Web Analytics” section) and other similar technologies.
      </p>
      <p>You may opt out of the automated collection of information by Google for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored to your interests, by visiting Google Ad Personalization page and/or Baidu Ad Personalization page.</p>
      <p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties where disclosure is both legally permissible and necessary to protect or defend our rights, matters of national security, law enforcement, to enforce our contracts or protect your rights or those of the public.</p>
      <p>Third parties connected with business transfers: We may transfer your personal information to third parties relating to a reorganisation, restructuring, merger, acquisition or transfer of assets, provided that the receiving party agrees to treat your personal information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h6 class="fw-bold">6. How do we protect your personal information?</h6>

        <li>Where applicable, advanced antivirus solutions are actively monitoring and protecting SKINCOMM<sup>&reg;</sup> systems from the work of malicious software and attacks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not store your credit card information. The credit card information you provide while transacting with us is solely used for effecting payment from you to us; which may involve third-party financial institutions, who implement industry-standard security mechanism.</p>
      <p>While we endeavour to protect our systems, website, operations and information against unauthorised access, use, modification and disclosure, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle and other risk factors, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission or while stored on our systems, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.</p>

      <h6 class="fw-bold">7. How long do we keep your personal information?</h6>

If your associate account has been inactive for 10 years, your personal data will be removed from our system.</p>

      <h6 class="fw-bold">8. Withdrawal of Consent, Access and Correction of Personal Data</h6>
      <p>You may withdraw your consent for the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal data by sending an email to our Data Protection Officer via email or approach our Customer Service Officer at our retail centres.
