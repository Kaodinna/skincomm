        <h3 class="pt-4 newsreader-style">How Effective Is The Daily 10 Step Skincare Routine?</h3>

        <div class="py-3">
          <p>Youthful and near flawless skin is everyone's dream, and to achieve that it is important to follow through a complete skin care regime. These are the basic 10 steps skin care routine, which we have broken down and highlighted some of the main functions.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 1: Make Up Remover</p>
          <p>
            This step is necessary if you have makeup like your mascara, eyeliner, and lipstick on which is harder to remove without an oil base cleansing function. Get one that will dissolve surface impurities without stripping your skin's natural protective layer.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 2: Water Based Cleanser</p>
          <p>
            After you've removed the majority of your makeup, make a clean sweep by using a water base cleanser to make sure you've removed any impurities your oil cleanser might've missed. Go for a clean formulation cleanser which is low in surfactant which will maintain your natural protective layer and suitable for all skin types including sensitive skin or eczema prone skin.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 3: Exfoliator</p>
          <p>
            It's important to exfoliate your skin that will buff away the dead skin cells for better skin care absorption. There are physical and chemical exfoliants in the market but be careful with the choice as most physical exfoliants contain particles that when rubbed onto the skin, can lead to irritation and cause more breakouts. Chemical exfoliants are better as they do not involve rubbing the skin, they are generally more effective for deeper exfoliation. Choose the right one which is effective and safe for long term usage. The right one will leave your skin smooth and radiant than before.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 4: Toner</p>
          <p>
            Toner should be the first product applied to your skin to adjust the pH levels before the application of expensive serums or creams. It is important to restore skin's pH balance after cleansing, especially with soaps or cleansers with high surfactant which will disrupt the skin's acid mantle, leaving skin more vulnerable to bacteria and susceptible to rashes, breakouts, and infection. It is also for better absorption of skin care actives.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 5: Essence</p>
          <p>
            Essence is a highly concentrated formula with a similar runny consistency as your toner. While it may seem like it's an unnecessary step, anyone obsessed with the 10 steps skin care regime can vouch that it's one of the most essential steps in prepping your skin for optimal absorption of skin care actives by increasing the cells permeability in the whole routine, check it up to see if it serves this function.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 6: Serum</p>
          <p>
            Serums are concentrated formula curated to treat any skin concerns you have - from skin sagginess, wrinkles to dryness, sensitivity, blemishes and hyperpigmentation, there's a serum for every concern. If you have multiple skin woes, you will need to use more than one to target different concerns. You will want to know which one to apply first and next, and to make sure they don't antagonise one another for maximum efficacy or they may even cause skin irritation.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 7: Masks</p>
          <p>
            The main benefit of masks is to boost treatment efficacy. You need to know your skin type and concerns to choose the suitable ones.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 8: Eye Cream</p>
          <p>
            Don't neglect the super delicate skin around your eyes, usually expression lines start showing in this area first. Gently apply the eye cream not only under your eyes, but also around it.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 9: Moisturiser</p>
          <p>
            The general function of a moisturiser is to give water and nutrients to the skin. The skin cells contain amino acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, more than 60% water and other trace elements. It is important to cells because without it they would not be able to remove waste, bring in nutrients or transport oxygen to function effectively. Drinking enough water and eating well may not be sufficient to keep the skin hydrated and nourished due to environmental aggressions. Moisturiser prevents water loss, protects and strengthens the external layers of the skin.
          </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Step 10: Sun Protection</p>
          <p>
            Nothing ages the skin faster than the harmful rays. The last but not least step in your skin care regime should be sunblock in the day even when you are home because the beside UVA & UVB, there are blue light and infrared rays which are emitted by electronic devices that can lead to premature aging, hyperpigmentation, and other skin concerns. <br>
            Adding a daily sunblock to your regular skin care regime can help improve the health and appearance of your complexion.
          </p>
          <p>
            10 products or more if you have multiple skin concerns seem like a lot of hassle to many and unnecessary time spent applying everything onto your face but it is essential for you to follow through the whole regime to look young and gorgeous. <br>
